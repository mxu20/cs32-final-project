### My CS32 Final Project: Global News Newsletter

### The Plan

In an effort to help people diversify their news diet and break out of the American media bubble, I am creating a daily newsletter to compile the top stories of news sites around the world. This will involve scraping several news sites, including Al Jazeera, BBC, South China Morning Post, for their top stories of the day. Then, I will need to compile the news in a newsletter.
